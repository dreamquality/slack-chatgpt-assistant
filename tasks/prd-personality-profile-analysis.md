# Product Requirements Document: Personality Profile Analysis with SSO Integration

## Introduction/Overview

This feature adds a new Slack command that analyzes conversation participants and generates personality profiles to help team members understand communication styles, identify potential conflicts, and improve team dynamics. The system integrates Google SSO for seamless authentication and uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for AI-powered personality analysis, eliminating the need for manual token management.

**Problem Statement:** Teams often experience communication breakdowns due to different personality types and communication styles. New team members struggle to understand existing team dynamics, leading to misunderstandings and reduced productivity.

**Goal:** Provide instant personality insights to help teams communicate more effectively and onboard new members faster.

## Goals

1. **Improve Team Communication:** Reduce misunderstandings by providing personality insights
2. **Accelerate Onboarding:** Help new team members understand team dynamics quickly
3. **Conflict Prevention:** Identify potential communication style conflicts before they escalate
4. **Seamless Authentication:** Eliminate manual token management through Google SSO
5. **Privacy-First:** Ensure analysis results are only visible to the requesting user

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

1. **As a team manager**, I want to analyze personality profiles in a conversation thread so that I can understand communication dynamics and prevent conflicts.

2. **As a new team member**, I want to quickly understand the personality profiles of my new colleagues so that I can adapt my communication style and integrate faster.

3. **As a developer**, I want to see personality analysis when communication breaks down so that I can adjust my approach and resolve misunderstandings.

### Secondary User Stories

4. **As a team lead**, I want to identify communication patterns so that I can optimize team collaboration.

5. **As a project manager**, I want to understand team dynamics so that I can assign tasks more effectively.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **Slack Command Integration**

   - The system must support a new Slack command `/personality-analyze` or `/analyze-profiles`
   - The command must be available in all channels where the bot is present
   - The command must work in both public channels and private channels

2. **Conversation Analysis**

   - The system must analyze up to 30 days of conversation history in the current channel
   - The system must identify all participants in the conversation
   - The system must exclude the bot's own messages from analysis
   - The system must handle conversations in multiple languages

3. **Personality Profile Generation**

   - The system must generate personality profiles for each participant including:
     - Communication style (direct/indirect, formal/informal)
     - Emotional tone (positive/negative/neutral)
     - Key personality traits (analytical, creative, supportive, etc.)
     - Communication patterns (response time, message length, etc.)
     - Potential communication preferences
     - Role identification (leader, supporter, critic, etc.)

4. **Analysis Report Format**

   - The system must provide analysis in both text and table format
   - The report must be sent as an ephemeral message (only visible to requester)
   - The report must include participant names and their profiles
   - The report must provide actionable recommendations for communication

5. **Edge Case Handling**
   - The system must return an appropriate message when only one person is in the conversation
   - The system must skip participants without profiles
   - The system must handle conversations in different languages
   - The system must gracefully handle API rate limits

### Authentication & Security

6. **Google SSO Integration**

   - The system must integrate with Google OAuth2 for user authentication
   - The system must eliminate manual token management
   - The system must use JWT for session management
   - The system must support secure token storage in httpOnly cookies

7. **Gemini 2.0 Flash Integration**

   - The system must use Gemini 2.0 Flash for AI analysis
   - The system must handle Gemini API authentication through Google SSO
   - The system must implement proper error handling for API failures
   - The system must support rate limiting and retry logic

8. **Privacy & Security**
   - The system must ensure analysis results are only visible to the requesting user
   - The system must not store conversation data permanently
   - The system must implement proper data sanitization
   - The system must comply with Slack's privacy guidelines

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Permanent Storage:** The system will not store personality profiles in a database
2. **Historical Tracking:** The system will not track personality changes over time
3. **Cross-Channel Analysis:** The system will not analyze personality across multiple channels
4. **Individual Profiling:** The system will not create detailed psychological assessments
5. **Team Management Features:** The system will not include team management or HR features
6. **Real-time Analysis:** The system will not provide real-time personality insights during conversations

## Design Considerations

### User Interface

- **Slack Integration:** All interactions must happen within Slack
- **Ephemeral Messages:** Analysis results must be private to the requester
- **Rich Formatting:** Use Slack's block kit for better presentation
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure readability on both desktop and mobile

### User Experience

- **Simple Command:** Easy-to-remember command syntax
- **Quick Response:** Analysis should complete within 30 seconds
- **Clear Results:** Easy-to-understand personality insights
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Provide specific communication tips

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture

- **Stateless Design:** No database required for personality storage
- **JWT-based Sessions:** Secure session management without server-side storage
- **Google Cloud Integration:** Leverage Google's ecosystem for SSO and AI
- **Modular Design:** Separate concerns for authentication, analysis, and presentation

### Dependencies

- **Google OAuth2:** For user authentication
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash API:** For AI-powered personality analysis
- **Slack Bolt Framework:** For Slack integration
- **JWT Library:** For token management

### Performance

- **Caching:** Cache conversation history to reduce API calls
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement proper rate limiting for both Slack and Gemini APIs
- **Async Processing:** Handle long-running analysis asynchronously
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of API failures

## Success Metrics

1. **User Adoption:** 70% of team members use the feature within 30 days
2. **Response Time:** Analysis completes within 30 seconds for 95% of requests
3. **User Satisfaction:** 4.5/5 rating for feature usefulness
4. **Conflict Reduction:** 20% reduction in communication-related issues
5. **Onboarding Speed:** 30% faster team integration for new members

## Open Questions

1. **Command Name:** Should we use `/personality-analyze` or `/analyze-profiles` or another name?
2. **Analysis Depth:** How detailed should the personality analysis be?
3. **Language Support:** Which languages should we prioritize for analysis?
4. **Rate Limiting:** What should be the daily limit for analysis requests per user?
5. **Integration Scope:** Should this integrate with existing Slack apps or remain standalone?

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP)

- Basic Slack command integration
- Simple personality analysis with Gemini 2.0 Flash
