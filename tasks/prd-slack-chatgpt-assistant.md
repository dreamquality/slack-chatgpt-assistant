# Product Requirements Document: Slack ChatGPT Assistant Bot

## Introduction/Overview

The Slack ChatGPT Assistant Bot is designed to help small teams (up to 10 people) consisting of managers and programmers quickly respond to complex client questions by analyzing conversation context. The bot uses ChatGPT API to analyze up to one month of conversation history and provides intelligent response suggestions without automatically responding. The bot operates through mentions and is visible only to the message owner for privacy.

## Goals

1. **Improve Response Quality**: Enhance the quality of responses to complex client questions by leveraging conversation context
2. **Save Time**: Reduce time spent crafting responses by providing intelligent suggestions
3. **Maintain Privacy**: Ensure bot suggestions are only visible to the requesting user
4. **Flexible Analysis**: Allow users to configure different conversation analysis methods
5. **Simple Integration**: Provide easy setup and configuration through conversation analysis

## User Stories

1. **As a manager**, I want to quickly respond to a complex client question using the context of our month-long conversation, so that I can provide accurate and comprehensive answers without spending hours reviewing the chat history.

2. **As a tester**, I want to get intelligent suggestions for responding to client bug reports by analyzing the conversation context, so that I can provide more helpful and contextual responses.

3. **As a team member**, I want to configure how the bot analyzes conversations (e.g., focus on recent messages vs. entire history), so that I can get the most relevant suggestions for different types of questions.

4. **As a user**, I want the bot suggestions to be private and only visible to me, so that I can maintain confidentiality while getting help with responses.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Bot Activation**: The system must respond to bot mentions (@bot_name) in any Slack channel, group, or direct message.

2. **Context Analysis**: The system must analyze up to one month of conversation history from the current channel/thread when activated.

3. **Data Processing**: The system must process text messages and reactions as primary data sources, with future capability for other data types.

4. **ChatGPT Integration**: The system must send conversation context to ChatGPT API for intelligent analysis and response generation.

5. **Suggestion Types**: The system must provide multiple types of suggestions:

   - Ready-to-use response templates
   - Improved versions of user's draft responses
   - Clarifying questions to ask the client
   - Contextual information summaries

6. **Privacy Control**: The system must ensure bot suggestions are only visible to the user who mentioned the bot (using ephemeral messages).

7. **Configuration Command**: The system must provide a separate command for configuring conversation analysis methods.

8. **Analysis Method Switching**: The system must allow users to switch between different conversation analysis approaches:

   - Full month history analysis
   - Recent messages focus (last week, last 3 days, etc.)
   - Thread-specific analysis
   - Keyword-based filtering

9. **Bot Setup**: The system must allow bot configuration through conversation analysis with ChatGPT API.

10. **Mobile Compatibility**: The system must work on mobile devices (planned for version 2).

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Automatic Responses**: The bot will NOT automatically respond to messages without user activation.
2. **External Integrations**: No integration with CRM, knowledge bases, or other external systems in the initial version.
3. **File Analysis**: File content analysis is not included in the initial scope (text and reactions only).
4. **Paid Features**: All features will be free in the initial version.
5. **Multi-language Support**: Only English language support in the initial version.
6. **Advanced Analytics**: No detailed usage analytics or reporting features.

## Design Considerations

### User Interface

- **Bot Activation**: Simple @mention syntax (@assistant help me respond to this)
- **Suggestion Display**: Clean, formatted suggestions with clear action buttons
- **Configuration Interface**: Simple command-based configuration (/assistant config)
- **Privacy Indicators**: Clear visual indicators that responses are private

### User Experience

- **Quick Response**: Suggestions should appear within 5-10 seconds
- **Clear Actions**: Each suggestion should have clear "Use this response" or "Modify" options
- **Context Awareness**: Bot should acknowledge the specific question being addressed
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures with helpful error messages

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Slack Integration**: Slack Bolt framework
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI ChatGPT API
- **Data Storage**: Simple file-based or lightweight database for configurations
- **Hosting**: Cloud platform (AWS, Heroku, or similar)

### Security & Privacy

- **API Key Management**: Secure storage of OpenAI API keys
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt conversation data in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized users can access bot features
- **Data Retention**: Implement data retention policies for conversation history

### Performance

- **Response Time**: Target 5-10 second response time for suggestions
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed conversation contexts
- **Scalability**: Design for easy scaling as user base grows

## Success Metrics

1. **Response Quality Improvement**: Measure improvement in response quality through user feedback
2. **Time Savings**: Track time saved per response (target: 50% reduction in response time)
3. **User Adoption**: Monitor bot usage frequency and user retention
4. **Suggestion Accuracy**: Track how often users accept vs. modify bot suggestions
5. **User Satisfaction**: Collect user feedback on suggestion relevance and helpfulness

## Open Questions

1. **Rate Limiting**: What are the specific rate limits for the ChatGPT API integration?
2. **Data Storage**: Should conversation history be stored locally or in a cloud database?
3. **Configuration Persistence**: How should user configurations be stored and shared across team members?
4. **Error Recovery**: What should happen if ChatGPT API is unavailable?
5. **Future Integrations**: Which external systems should be prioritized for future versions?
6. **Mobile Experience**: What specific mobile UI considerations are needed for version 2?

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP)

- Basic bot activation via mentions
- Simple context analysis (last 30 days)
- ChatGPT integration for suggestions
- Privacy controls (ephemeral messages)
- Basic configuration command

### Phase 2 (Enhanced)

- Multiple analysis methods
- Advanced configuration options
- Mobile optimization
- Performance improvements

### Phase 3 (Advanced)

- File analysis capabilities
- External integrations
- Advanced analytics
- Paid features (if monetization is pursued)
